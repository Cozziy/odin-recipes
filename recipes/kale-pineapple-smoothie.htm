    <p>Description: It took a while to get into the green smoothie trend. We much preferred a sweet tasting berry burst, but this delicious glass of green goodness is divine. The pineapple chunks add a delicious sweet taste to the drink so it doesn't taste as bitter as other green smoothies. It makes the perfect healthy breakfast or post-workout snack.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients:
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh pineapple chunks</li>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped kale</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Directions: Place pineapple, coconut milk, banana, and kale in a blender; blend until smooth.</p>
